## üîí Security Design

* **VRF Separation** (optional):

  * `VRF-K12` ‚Äì for school networks
  * `VRF-PD` ‚Äì for police department
  * `VRF-TOWN` ‚Äì for town hall
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** on edge interfaces
* **NAT** and **public IP** handled at the CEN edge router
* **DHCP relays** on core for centralized IP assignment

---

## üì∂ Wireless Design

* Centralized **WLC at CEN Core**
* 5 APs per school, centrally managed
* WLAN-to-VLAN mappings:
  
  * `PS-Staff` ‚Üí VLAN 10
  * `PS-Student` ‚Üí VLAN 20
  * `Town-Public` ‚Üí VLAN 101
---

## üîÅ Routing

* **OSPF** between routers and the CEN core switch
