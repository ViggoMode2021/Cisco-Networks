# Connecticut-Runs-On-PowerShell
Automation is as fun and addictive as a nice cup of coffee. PowerShell is the vehicle in which it thrives.

# About the motivation for this repository #

PowerShell is my favorite 'programming' language. To me, curating scripts to automate menial tasks and pushing the envelope to make them robust is what I have been living for.

I work doing help desk/assistant systems administration work and when I am not studying IT theories and best practices, I am taking to the terminal/IDE to figure out how to make the most of Windows and Windows Server/Active Directory. In tech, I hear a lot of Windows slander and heavy Linux/Unix bias. I do love Linux and see the beauty in it, but the reality is that most people in the real world work with Windows, especially in a corporate/educational environment. Therefore, why not capitalize on making the best of it? PowerShell is robust and is our friend. I don't know everything about Windows, PowerShell, or tech/IT/software dev, but this repository will only grow in conjunction with my knowledge. 

Connecticut is my home state and I love it. I am looking to use this repository to connect with other help desk, sysadmins, and otherwise PowerShell developers throughout the state (and even into the rest of New England). As far as I'm concerned, there hasn't been an established PowerShell community within the Constitution State. 

# About this repository #

This repository is a central hub for the PowerShell scripts that I have created. Some I have created for work, and some I have created for personal use. Both types of scripts can be used in Windows and/or Windows server environments. The four categories of scripts are: General Windows, Windows Server & Active Directory, Networking, and Educational. A few of the scripts have their own separate repositories on my GitHub page as well.  

# About the creator #

This repository is the main hub of PowerShell scripts written by Connecticut native, Ryan Viglione. A former high school Spanish teacher turned IT worker and aficionado,
Ryan began coding with Python in May 2021. As of 2023, Ryan holds two AWS certifications (Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate) and the Terriform Associate certificate. He took a bootcamp on Python, SQL, and DevOps from November 2021 - March 2022 and graduated with honors. 

Life after the bootcamp saw Ryan working on his biggest project to date, VigLMS.org, a learning management system similar to PowerSchool. VigLMS was created to facilitate Ryan's main goal of creating software for both educators and students. VigLMS is written in the Python web framework, Flask, and utilizes PostgreSQL as its database. It also capitalized on services like AWS S3 for file (object) storage and AWS Cognito for user authentication. VigLMS was hosted on Google Cloud App Engine and utilized CloudFlare for TLS. VigLMS had to be taken down due to budgeting reasons. 

In November 2023, Ryan started working in the IT department at a local school district. His interests in System Administration, Windows Server, Networking, and of course, PowerShell, grew in tandem with his newly found responsibilities.
